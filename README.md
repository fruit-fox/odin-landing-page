# odin-landing-page

This is the Landing Page project from The Odin Project's Foundation Course!

I will be practicing creating HTML structure and styling with CSS and Flexbox from scratch with only a reference sheet for the colors and typography. Hopefully, by the end of completing this project, I will be able to make better sense of Flexbox and feel more comfortable with creating page layouts!
